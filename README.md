## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is the first project I did completely on my own.

- Implemented max width-height constraints
- Got a clear understanding of the Box Model
- Implemented Flexbox and understood its usage
- Learnt to build responsive pages using Media Queries


### Continued development

As this is my first project, many of my concepts were cleared but further practice is needed to gain more expertise. And so, a few of my next projects will be based on CSS Flexbox. Further, media queries need to explored more to build better pages.

### Useful resources
